RedBlock vs. Richard
!RedBlock vs. Richard

Description
RedBlock vs. Richard is my first Pygame project, created as a learning experience to explore the mechanics and fundamentals of game development using Python. Inspired by classic arcade games, this project allowed me to dive into the world of 2D graphics, sound effects, and player interaction.

Features:
Graphics:
Utilizes Pygameâ€™s simple yet effective tools for creating dynamic and engaging 2D graphics.
Includes sprites for RedBlock (our hero) and Richard (the villain).
Animations for movement, collisions, and power-ups.
Sound:
Adds sound effects for actions like jumping, collecting power-ups, and defeating enemies.
Background music to enhance the gaming experience.
Game Mechanics:
RedBlock can jump, run, and dodge obstacles.
Richard (the AI opponent) follows predefined patterns.
Collect power-ups for temporary invincibility or speed boosts.
Learning Journey:
Pygame Basics:
Learned how to create a game loop, handle events, and manage game states.
Explored sprite handling, collision detection, and rendering.
Game Design:
Designed levels, obstacles, and enemy behavior.
Balanced difficulty to keep players engaged.
Code Structure:
Organized code into classes (e.g., Player, Enemy, PowerUp).
Used modular functions for readability.
Installation:
Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
Open a terminal/command prompt and check Pythonâ€™s version:
python --version

If Python is installed, proceed to check if pip is available:
pip --version

Install Pygame:
pip install pygame
